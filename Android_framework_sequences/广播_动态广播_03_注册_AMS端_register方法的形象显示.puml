class AMS{
{field} HashMap<IBinder, ReceiverList> mRegisteredReceivers
}

note bottom of AMS
属性 mRegisteredReceivers：
Keeps track of all IIntentReceivers that have been registered for broadcasts.
Hash keys are the receiver IBinder, hash value is a ReceiverList.
end note

IIntentReceiver "1" -- "1" ReceiverList : one have one
class IIntentReceiver{
   IBinder asBinder()
}
IIntentReceiver --|> Binder
Binder ..|> IBinder

ArrayList <|-- ReceiverList

class ArrayList<? extends BroadcastFilter>{
}

ArrayList "1" *-- "many" BroadcastFilter : have many >

BroadcastFilter --|> IntentFilter : extends

note bottom of IntentFilter
Structured description of Intent values to be matched.  An IntentFilter can
match against actions, categories, and data (either via its type, scheme,
and/or path) in an Intent.  It also includes a "priority" value which is
used to order multiple matching filters.
end note



'添加进去的主要代码：
 '1.ReceiverList rl = mRegisteredReceivers.get(receiver.asBinder());
 'ReceiverList类的定义如下,
 '"final class ReceiverList extends ArrayList<BroadcastFilter>"
 '里面的数据类型BroadcastFilter，定义如下，
 '"final class BroadcastFilter extends IntentFilter",
 '即BroadcastFilter 就是 IntentFilter。
 '
 'mRegisteredReceivers
 'key为 IIntentReceiver对应的Binder，
 'value为 对应的ReceiverList。
 '
 '2.rl.app.receivers.add(rl);
 '
 '3.mRegisteredReceivers.put(receiver.asBinder(), rl);
 '
 '4.BroadcastFilter bf = new BroadcastFilter(filter, rl, callerPackage,
 '                      permission, callingUid, userId, instantApp, visibleToInstantApps);
 '5.mReceiverResolver.addFilter(bf);'
